Switch to "Test Design" mode.

Create a comprehensive set of test cases for the user story identified by `<user-story-id>`.

**Guidelines for creating test cases:**
- Cover both positive (happy path) and negative scenarios.
- Include tests for edge cases and boundary conditions.
- Ensure each test case is clear, concise, and has a specific, verifiable objective.
- Reference the user story's acceptance criteria to ensure complete coverage.
